\chapter{About This Document}
In this chapter we are going to take a look at general structure of DeepPoint-V1 and some details about the tools that have been used to develop it.
\section{Intro}
This document is meant to be a detailed guide to understand the source code for each one of the kernels and the challenges that are known for each scenario.
Most of the material here has documented while Deep-Point was under development, so, they might not be updated as you would expect but they are intended to be a good starting point to dive into the project.

\section{Repository Information}
This document is a part of Deep-Point-FPGA project which is open-source. The Deep-Point-FGPA is a subset of Deep-Point focusing on implementing it on FPGAs.
